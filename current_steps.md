Current thought process:

* create a new process with the new scripts so it will only pull updates
* figure out a better(?) way to get yelp ids
* look at the possibility of pullin all reports regardless of type? (do inspection ids increment by 1 reliabely?)
* look at implementing scrapey?
* rewrite, if possible, so pages aren't pulled down locally for parsing
*  ...
